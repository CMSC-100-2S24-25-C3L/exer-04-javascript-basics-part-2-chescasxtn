**What are you key takeaways from this exercise?**
The exercise taught me how to export one function from one file and import them into another file. I also learned that I could create a .gitignore file to ignore files and folders when I am pushing my code. I also learned that I should always double check because I accidently used the CommonJS instead of the ES Module hihi. (〃￣ω￣〃ゞ
